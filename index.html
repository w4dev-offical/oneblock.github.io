  <p>Oneblock â€” a game based on Minecraft but here there will be more opportunities to make that big bang that created the planet, a quantum computer, a new virus that will destroy the planet TJune, your own black hole that will be bigger than ton527, and much more. Think of the world of Oneblock as a simulation of our time on your computer. The important thing is that it all started with a big bang. All the analogs of our galaxy are at your fingertips... ATTENTION, the game is in early development and the maximum that you can do is to somehow get into the team of testers.</p>
  <h2>Story</h2>
  <p>
    Once there was neither light nor darkness, neither earth nor sky. There was only emptiness, infinite and motionless. In that void, the first consciousness awakened - you, the Creator. You did not know where you came from, but you realized one thing: the world had to be created. You stretched out your hand, and the first cube, the basis of reality, flashed in the void. The second, third cube appeared after it... The space began to fill with matter. You created the sky and the sea, built the mountains, filled the rivers with water and the earth with life. But your power is not infinite. To become stronger, you need faith. The world is empty, and you need intelligent beings to worship you, build civilizations, and develop culture. But can they become worthy of your power? Or will they turn it against themselves?

    You have breathed soul into the first people. Now their and TJune's story begins.
